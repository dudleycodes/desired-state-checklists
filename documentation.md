# Desired State Checklist: Documentation

* I like documentation that expresses its goals upfront.
* I like documents, posts, etc, that by in large, fall into one category and stay consistent:
  * **Tutorials** are learning oriented.
  * **How To Guide**: problem oriented, like recipes.
  * **Discussion**: Understanding oriented, like deep-dives.
  * **Reference**: Information oriented, easy to browse for nuggets or look up specific concepts.
  * I like documentation that prioritizes text over multimedia. [Always bet on text](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/193447.html) ([archive link](https://archive.is/kuoje)).
